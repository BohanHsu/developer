How to run the code:
1. goto src directory:
cd ./src
2. problem1
run 
python problem1.py
will output the result of problem1 to standard output in CSV format, the first colunm is the training set name, second column is lambda's value, the third column is training set mse, the last column is test set mse.

3. problem2
run
python problem2.py
will output the result of problem2 to standard output in CSV format, the first column is the training set's size, the second column is the lambda's value, the third column is training set mse value, the last colunm is test set mse value.

4. problem3
run 
python problem3.py
will output the result of problem3 to standard output in CSV format, the first column is the training set's name, the second column is the lambda's value, the last column is the cross validation mse.

6. Discussion
1. 
How dose lambda affect MSE in general?
By increasing lambda's value, trains set and test set MSE will fall at the very begining, but will keep increase as the lambda increased.

How does the choice of lambda depend on the number of features vs. examples?
??????

How does lambda change with number of examples when the number of features is fixed?
lambda will increase as the number of examples increased

3.
How do the values for lambda and MSE obtained from CV compare to the ones in question 1?

What are the drawbacks of CV?
It require more training times.

What are thre factors affecting the performance of CV?
number of examples, number of features, k's value
